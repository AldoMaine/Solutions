# Optimization Algorithms in Python
A collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks developed to solve optimzation problems

## About me
As an engineer, I enjoy finding solutions to a variety of problems. I also have an analytical side that leads me to search for a better understanding of the problem or find an optimal solution.   This usually takes the form of a Python script or notebook.

I've used a lot of computer languages, applications and tools in my career to implement solutions.  Fortran, tksolver, C#, MATLAB, etc. A  colleague suggested I try a scientific distribution of Python a couple of years ago.  I found it easy to adopt and the numerical and analysis libraries are awesome. The IPython/Jupyter notebook makes it easy to share code, diagrams and text with others.    For what it is worth, I use a 64bit Anaconda distribution on Windows 10.    

Hope someone finds some of this useful.
