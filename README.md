# Optimization Algorithms in Python
A collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks developed to solve optimzation problems

## Notebooks

[Bin Packing with Multiple Bin Sizes](notebooks/Bin_Packing_Multiple_Bin_Sizes.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AldoMaine/Solutions/HEAD?labpath=%2Fnotebooks%2FBin_Packing_Multiple_Bin_Sizes.ipynb)
    A brute force approach to selecting the optimal set of bins to meet an order when there are multiple stock sizes available. 
    
[Tramp Steamer Problem with Python](notebooks/Tramp_Steamer.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AldoMaine/Solutions/HEAD?labpath=%2Fnotebooks%2FTramp_Steamer.ipynb)
    A solution to the classic optimization problem of finding the most profitable route for a cargo ship. Sequential search and Binary search are implemented to solve a simple example.

## About me
As a retired engineer, I enjoy finding solutions to a variety of problems. I also have an analytical side that leads me to search for a better understanding of the problem and find an optimal solution.   This usually takes the form of a Python script or notebook.

I've used a lot of computer languages, applications and tools in my career to implement solutions; from Fortran to MATLAB. A  colleague suggested I try a scientific distribution of Python.  I found it easy to adopt and the numerical and analysis libraries are awesome. The IPython/Jupyter notebook makes it easy to share code, diagrams and text with others.  I'm running a 64bit Anaconda distribution on Windows 10.
