# Optimization Algorithms in Python
A collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks developed to solve optimzation problems

## Notebooks

[Bin Packing with Multiple Bin Sizes](notebooks/Bin_Packing_Multiple_Bin_Sizes.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AldoMaine/Solutions/HEAD?labpath=%2Fnotebooks%2FBin_Packing_Multiple_Bin_Sizes.ipynb)
    A brute force approach to selecting the optimal set of bins to meet an order when there are multiple stock sizes available. 
    
[Tramp Steamer Problem with Python](notebooks/Tramp_Steamer.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AldoMaine/Solutions/HEAD?labpath=%2Fnotebooks%2FTramp_Steamer.ipynb)
    A solution to the classic optimization problem of finding the most profitable route for a cargo ship. Sequential search and Binary search are implemented to solve a simple example.
